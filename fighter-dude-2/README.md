# Fighter Dude 2 - Refactoring Kata

**Note** _This kata is a port of Declan Hopkins' **Fighter Dude 2 - Refactoring Kata** in Rust. To try this kata in
Rust, please visit the [original repo](https://github.com/Dooskington/FighterDude2-RefactoringKata)._

This is a tiny refactoring kata that I made to exercise some of the refactorings in Chapter 6 of Refactoring by Martin
Fowler.

This program was designed years ago to help calculate player and NPC power levels for the new hit video game, FIGHTER
DUDE 2. It's your first day on the job and you're the new maintainer for the tool, but you don't understand how it
works!
Luckily, the original author at least left a few tests and comments behind. Maybe some refactoring is in order...

It's important that no behavior changes as a result of these refactorings!

- slide statement
- extract function
- inline function
- inline variable
- introduce parameter object
- split variable
- replace temp with query
- change function declaration
    - simple mechanics
    - migration mechanics
- write an actual good test for calculation?
