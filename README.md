# Kotlin Refactoring Katas

A collection of katas either copied or ported from some amazing folks.

## Objectives

- Make it easy to practice your refactoring skills in Kotlin without cloning or searching for individual repos.

## What's in here?

The following list contains katas grouped under the names of folks who maintain them along with the number of lines of
code sorted by ascending order. While LOC may not say much, you can still use it as a proxy to gauge the complexity of
the problem each exercise presents.

**[Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache)**

- [Gilded Rose](/gilded-rose) LOC 97
- [Supermarket Receipt](/supermarket-receipt) LOC 238
- [Tennis](/tennis) LOC 326

**[Declan Hopkins](https://github.com/Dooskington)**

- [Fighter Dude 2](/fighter-dude-2) LOC 64

## Tools

Feel free to use any tool or technique you see fit to practice your refactoring skills. All exercies in the repo have
JUnit 5 as the default testing framework for you to get started with.

The modules do not have an assertion library or any other tools apart from JUnit 5.

### Recommendations

The following are some of my favorites, and I might be biased. So feel free to do your research and pick the ones that
suit your use case.

- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - Obvious, for it's Kotlin support and IDE-assisted refactoring
  capabilities.
- [Truth](https://github.com/google/truth) - Assertion library.
- [ApprovalTests.Java](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Java) - For bringing large portions of code under test
  quickly.
- [ApprovalTests IntelliJ Plugin](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Plugins.IntelliJ) - IDE support for
  ApprovalTests, only supports Kotlin at the moment.
- [TCR Extension](https://github.com/LarsEckart/tcr-extension) - A TCR extension that can accelerate the pace of your
  refactoring workflow.
